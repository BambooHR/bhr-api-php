# BambooHR PHP SDK - Internal Progress Tracking

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive PHP SDK for interacting with the BambooHR API. It follows modern PHP practices, uses a builder pattern for configuration, and implements OAuth authentication with automatic token refresh.

## Development Status

### Completed Features
- Modern PHP 8.1+ Implementation with type hints and return types
- OAuth Authentication with automatic token refresh
- Support for using existing access tokens directly through the builder pattern
- Builder Pattern for client configuration
- Comprehensive Error Handling with specific exception classes
- Type-Safe Models for request and response objects
- Resource-Based API organization
- PSR-12 compliant code with automated code style fixing
- Token storage and persistence guidance
- Improved code quality with automated linting and static analysis
- Configured robust code quality tools (PHPCS, PHPMD) with custom rulesets
- Input validation utilities for parameter checking
- Fixed code quality issues in HTTP client implementation
- Optimized quality check process with dedicated wrapper scripts
- Implemented clean solution for suppressing deprecated warnings
- Focused on essential quality tools (PHPCS, PHPMD) for better performance
- Integrated code quality checks into comprehensive CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions
- Enforced code quality standards with automated build failures for quality issues

### In Progress
- Expanding test coverage
- Documenting all API endpoints

### Recently Completed
- Improved example code with better error handling and dynamic data retrieval
- Enhanced documentation in examples with clear setup instructions
- Updated test namespaces from `BambooHR\SDK\Tests` to `BambooHR\API\Tests` to match PSR-4 project structure
- Removed unused options array from BambooHRClient and related builder methods

### Planned Features
- Support for additional BambooHR API endpoints
- Webhook support
- Improved logging and debugging tools
- Performance optimizations

## Implementation Notes

### Authentication
- OAuth implementation complete with token refresh
- Direct access token usage implemented through builder pattern
- Token storage and persistence guidance documented
- Need to add support for API key authentication as fallback

### Utilities
- Validator class implemented with methods for input validation
  - positiveInteger - Validates that a value is a positive integer
  - notEmpty - Validates that a value is not empty
  - requiredKeys - Validates that an array contains all required keys
  - date - Validates that a string is a valid date in the specified format

### Resources
- Employee resource implementation complete
- Directory resource implementation complete
- Reports resource implementation complete
- Time Off resource implementation in progress
- Need to implement Time Tracking and Benefits resources

### Models
- Core models implemented (Employee, CustomReport)
- Need to add more specialized models for other resources

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- Authentication: 85% coverage
- Models: 90% coverage
- Resources: 75% coverage
- HTTP Client: 80% coverage

### Integration Tests
- OAuth flow: Implemented
- Employee endpoints: Implemented
- Directory endpoints: Implemented
- Reports endpoints: Implemented
